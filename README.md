**Overview of EchoCLR, a self-supervised learning approach for echocardiography.** Unlike standard contrastive learning methods, two distinct videos of each patient acquired during a single exam are randomly sampled and deemed positive pairs for “multi-instance” contrastive learning (A). The frames of each video are then randomly shuffled along the temporal axis and fed into a 3D CNN, which learns similar representations of distinct videos from the same patient and dissimilar representations of videos from different patients (B). These video-level representations are then used to directly predict the order of shuffled video frames. This frame reordering pretext task encourages temporal coherence, which we demonstrate to be beneficial for downstream echocardiogram video-based disease classification tasks (C). After self-supervised pretraining, the 3D CNN backbone can then be efficiently fine-tuned for cardiac disease classification based on very few labeled echocardiograms.
